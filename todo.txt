Immediate goals:
Allow creation of Proposals
Play knowledge allows for the "Play Alone" and "Play With Others" actions, the second of which leads to the creation of a basic 'Play' proposal, which sends an invite to another player (or players) to engage in this activity and restore happiness for all those involved.
Proposals are destroyed at end of turn if not accepted, and executed and then destroyed if they are accepted
Allow players to trade items as a proposal, introduce system for counterproposal
Allow creation of Messages and Broadcasts
The gestures system allows the player to send messages to other player, or to the market as a whole (a broadcast), by selecting from a few preset actions and selecting references. For example, "Point At", followed by targeting either an item or a person.
Messages and broadcasts are destroyed after they are viewed by their targets, until the appropriate knowledges are gained
"Pondering" the Gesture knowledge opens up the Language knowledge, which replaces the selection of gestures with the ability to type out messages freehand to those who also have this knowledge.
Allow creation of traits
Remove cap on action queue, it was a dumb idea
Remove display of duplicates in the ponder screen
Remove the "contains" column from character_possessions
--STYLE BREAK--
  Standardize info-block labels
  Handle span lists and list lists in info blocks

BUGLIST AND SECURITY CONCERNS:
By editing the URL, people will be able to send Proposals across worlds
Everything right now is handled by get requests, we should probably switch post request to... post requests.
