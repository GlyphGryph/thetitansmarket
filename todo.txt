Immediate goals:
Make "character actions" dependent destroy on characters OR actions
Make "characters" dependent destroy on worlds (not users, we'll want to handle that a different way so as not to lose history)
When all players are ready, display an execute button that any player can select
When the player selects this button, "execute" all actions in each queue (which currently do nothing) and then clear it
Add a "timer" to each world
The Execute action advanced the timer
Introduce a "show" action for characters so other players can view characters, view name only for now
Include a list of peers so player can examine other characters in a world
Disallow actions on noncontrolled characters, redirect to the character "show" action


--Later on--
Allow creation of conditions
Allow creation of traits
Allow hooking both of those up to characters

Characters have the following stats:
Health (hp)
Max Health (max_hp)
Happiness (happy)
Max Happiness (max_happy)
Action Points (ap)
Maximum Action Points (max_ap)
Conditions: [basic hunger, basic dissatisfaction, basic recovery, mortal]
Traits: [hard worker, nimble fingers, keen eyes, sharp mind, pretty face, organized multitasker, big heart]
