Immediate goals:
-STYLE BREAK- :: Do some basic styling of the various pages to make navigation and information management easier.

--Later on--
Allow player to view their characters full history.
Generate an exploration pool for each world's potential results
Populate the deck "wildlands" and "generic object" items.
Allow creation of knowledges.
Add basic farming knowledge, which grants the Clear Land, Collect Seeds, Plant, and Harvest actions.
Put all actions behind a knowledge barrier
Start characters with cognition, play, gestures as knowledges
Players can use the 'Ponder' action (from cognition), to uncover research options, and then the "Investigate" action to pursue them. Ponder results can be kept secret or made public, and can target conditions, items, and knowledges. Pondering plants has a high chance of granting the basic farming knowledge.
Allow creation of Proposals
Play knowledge allows for the "Play Alone" and "Play With Others" actions, the second of which leads to the creation of a basic 'Play' proposal, which sends an invite to another player (or players) to engage in this activity and restore happiness for all those involved.
Proposals are destroyed at end of turn if not accepted, and executed and then destroyed if they are accepted
Allow players to trade items as a proposal, introduce system for counterproposal
Allow creation of Messages and Broadcasts
The gestures system allows the player to send messages to other player, or to the market as a whole (a broadcast), by selecting from a few preset actions and selecting references. For example, "Point At", followed by targeting either an item or a person.
Messages and broadcasts are destroyed after they are viewed by their targets, until the appropriate knowledges are gained
"Pondering" the Gesture knowledge opens up the Language knowledge, which replaces the selection of gestures with the ability to type out messages freehand to those who also have this knowledge.
Allow creation of traits

Health (hp)
Max Health (max_hp)
