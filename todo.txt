Immediate goals:
Knowledge Expansion:
  Add a "progress" and "max_progress" attribute to character knowledges.
  "considers" returns true only when progress is not nil, and "knows" returns true when progress equals max
  The duration of teaching is the difference between progress and max progress for the learning character.
  Display this amount.
  Modify the cost of investigation to be the progress remaining to learn a skill. Reduce the "normal" cost of investigation to zero.
  Display the cost on the investigation target select page.
  Add the ability to specify an amount of learning to be done in both cases.
  Remove the cost display for 'free' tasks with no inherent cost (eating, investigation).
  Have "craft basket" and "craft cutting tool" investigations consume resources and result in a product. 
  Make investigations not guaranteed to succeed based on a difficulty attached to the idea, add failure messages and handling of failure messages for failed investigations.

Items Expansion:
  Add a "uses" attribute to "character_possessions", pulled from a "max uses" value in the possession definition. 
  Make Farms, Dolait groves and Wampoon deposits pull from this, and revert to an empty field if there are none left.
  Add an "age" method to possessions. Run this for each item each time the world turns. Dolait groves should increase the amount of Dolait uses by 10% (up to max) each turn. At the end of turn, any unharvested farm should lose all remaining uses and revert to an empty field.

Hunger Expansion:
  Turn "Eat" into an explicit (free) action that lets you target some food quality item you possess and removes the "hunger" condition. If characters haven't eaten enough, they will eat anything available randomly to stave off hunger.
  Add a "target_allowed" flag that works like target required, but with a default option specified, usually "Any Available" or "None"
  Have hunger actually require a certain amount of "nutrition" each turn, and food provides an amount based on the level of it's food quality. Eating reduces this value until it reaches zero and then removes the condition.

Traits
  Allow creation of traits

Content Expansion: Communication
  Allow players to add additional gestures/texts
  Allow players to actually target their gestures at things other than the other player. (Well, this will quickly get complex)
  Allow building of message chains composed of multiple gestures and texts.

Create "Cooking" knowledge based on pondering Fire, which grants the "cook" action (1ap). This sacrifices a Dolait to turn a basic food into a "Meal" which restores some happiness in addition to restoring the same amount of nutrition as the previous item. Meals execute to "spoil" at the end of turn and get destroyed.
Remove display of duplicates in the ponder screen (Harder than it looks, since right now ponder is processed against content_possessions...)
Async changes to character stats as the result of conditions and actions - track temporary values, and then commit them (only then comparing to things like max or min possible values) only at the end of the execution run.
Add teaching proposal!
Investigate's cost is based on the idea to be investigated.
Add requirements for thoughts. Example: You can only come up with the idea to craft toys if you ponder weariness AFTER you've researched the basics of crafting.
Actions should return a full "status" object, with messages to pass, success or failure, an id for what happened. This will allow for historical comparison (actions that only work if another action is used this turn), and the refunding of AP for an aborted action (trying to use an item that is stolen for example).

--REFACTOR BREAK--
Actions stuff:
 Improve the "impossible" results and item requirement checking logic, track the actual items that are missing for the building of more effective lack of requirement messages.
 Implement a general lack of requirements message instead of having each action define it's own, though the action should still probably contribute a unique component. This is so we can have a complex "list all items and other things missing and the amounts that were required" sort of thing without complex message logic in the action definition.
--/REFACTOR BREAK--



--CONTENT BREAK--
???Forage requires wildlands to forage in, target_allowed stuff would need to work first though
??Add explore result that results in a concussion and the loss of a knowledge - Should wait until things can be taught!
--CONTENT BREAK--

--FAR FUTURE--
More robust system for handling crafting. Introduce item qualities, have quality degrade from use. Have items break if used at low quality.
Allow creation of language variants. Players can create custom langauges (and know multiple languages) but only communicate via text to those who know the same language (making a kind of game out of getting one language to dominate for ease of communication vs. the effort of learning a new language). Obviously, this will require teaching/learning to be implemented first.
Allow hiding items, and a config to hide new items be default. Also allow making them publicly viewable. Perhaps require the player to build a shack first?
Allow creation of broadcasts
Pull the item list from the worlds instead of from a global item list, and vary the resulting items, esp. qualities. Change the current item stuff to be templates rather than final definitions, with multiple options for various bits to build the real item base.
Have lots of variant wildlands with their own forage results, and have deposits be an attribute on wildlands. Deposits will be hidden until something something something.
Add remembered tasks. Make sure the task is remembered as a % of task completed.
"Strife", the knowledge of attacking other players, becomes a starting knowledge. Strife is a type of proposal that is automatically and immediately executed. The basic knowledge grants the "attack' proposal at a cost of 3ap(+10 from physical injury). The attacker has two 50% chances of dealing 1 damage to the defender, and the defender has one 50% chance of dealing 1 damage to the attacker. Attacking or being attacked by someone gives you the idea "brawling", which increases your odds when both attacking and defending to 75%.
Add the "craft weapon" knowledge and "weapon" item, made from tomatunk.
Considering another player gives several ideas depending. If they have possessions, you gain the idea of "theft", which allows you to try and steal items. If they are hurt, you gain the idea of "caretaking", which allows you to improve another player's healing for a turn.
Add a settting to allow players to turn off auto-eating and force-starve themselves.
Investigation knowledge model. Each "knowledge" is made up of several "pieces of the puzzle". Investigation offers several random selections from the pieces of the puzzle list and grants them to the player. When the player has all the pieces of the puzzle, they gain the knowledge. Players can share their pieces of the puzzle with other players. Earlier, basic knowledges may only have one piece to their puzzles.
Add random events each turn.
Add constructions - fences and houses. Both reduce chance of items getting stolen.

Characters have the following stats yet to be implemented:
Happiness (happy)
Max Happiness (max_happy)
Traits: [hard worker, nimble fingers, keen eyes, sharp mind, pretty face, organized multitasker, big heart]

BUGLIST AND SECURITY CONCERNS:
Need to enforce that offered and asked items are properly limited to items from their respective owners.
Everything right now is handled by get requests, we should probably switch post request to... post requests.
