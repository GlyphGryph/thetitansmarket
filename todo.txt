Immediate goals:
Bugfix: Investigating Language doesn't properly do so.
"Pondering" the Gesture knowledge opens up the Language knowledge, which replaces the selection of gestures with the ability to type out messages freehand to those who also have this knowledge.
Allow players to add additional gestures/texts
Allow players to actually target their gestures at things other than the other player. (Well, this will quickly get complex)
Might want to handle building a message out over several pages, thinking about it...
Add a 'reply' button to messages in the index AND on the show page for quick replies.
Limit message body length in index, only add a 'show' link if there's more message, call it something like 'see more'
Allow creation of traits
Remove display of duplicates in the ponder screen
Remove the "contains" column from character_possessions
Make sure proposals track the turn they were created, and push old proposals into history. Make sure to change their state to closed, and add grey styling for closed/ignored proposals.
Add explore result that results in a concussion and the loss of a knowledge
--STYLE BREAK--
  Standardize info-block labels
  Handle span lists and list lists in info blocks
--/STYLE BREAK--

--FAR FUTURE--
Allow creation of language variants. Players can create custom langauges (and know multiple languages) but only communicate via text to those who know the same language (making a kind of game out of getting one language to dominate for ease of communication vs. the effort of learning a new language). Obviously, this will require teaching/learning to be implemented first.
Allow hiding items, and a config to hide new items be default. Also allow making them publicly viewable. Perhaps require the player to build a shack first?
Allow creation of broadcasts

Characters have the following stats yet to be implemented:
Happiness (happy)
Max Happiness (max_happy)
Traits: [hard worker, nimble fingers, keen eyes, sharp mind, pretty face, organized multitasker, big heart]

BUGLIST AND SECURITY CONCERNS:
By editing the URL, people will be able to send Proposals across worlds. Additionally, need to enforce that offered and asked items are properly limited to items from their respective owners.
Everything right now is handled by get requests, we should probably switch post request to... post requests.
Errors in the world turning allow for free execution of queued actions for one player
