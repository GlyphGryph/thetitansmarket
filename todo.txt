Allow player to "control" a character, and see the summary information for that character and world
Allow player to return to the master list
Allow player to queue "actions" to execute (Default: Rest, Farm, Craft)
Allow player to see the action queue
Allow player to remove items from the action queue
Allow players to select a "ready" button to update a "ready" status
