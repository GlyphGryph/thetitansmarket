Immediate goals:
Play knowledge allows for the "Play Alone" and "Play With Others" actions, the second of which leads to the creation of a basic 'Play' proposal, which sends an invite to another player (or players) to engage in this activity and restore happiness for all those involved.
Proposals are destroyed at end of turn if not accepted, and executed and then destroyed if they are accepted
Allow creation of Messages and Broadcasts
The gestures system allows the player to send messages to other player, or to the market as a whole (a broadcast), by selecting from a few preset actions and selecting references. For example, "Point At", followed by targeting either an item or a person.
"Pondering" the Gesture knowledge opens up the Language knowledge, which replaces the selection of gestures with the ability to type out messages freehand to those who also have this knowledge.
Add a 'reply' button to messages in the index AND on the show page for quick replies.
Limit message body length in index, only add a 'show' link if there's more message, call it something like 'see more'
Allow creation of traits
Remove cap on action queue, it was a dumb idea
Remove display of duplicates in the ponder screen
Remove the "contains" column from character_possessions
Make sure proposals track the turn they were created, and push old proposals into history. Make sure to change their state to closed, and add grey styling for closed/ignored proposals.
--STYLE BREAK--
  Standardize info-block labels
  Handle span lists and list lists in info blocks
--/STYLE BREAK--

--FAR FUTURE--
Allow hiding items, and a config to hide new items be default. Also allow making them publicly viewable. Perhaps require the player to build a shack first?

Characters have the following stats yet to be implemented:
Happiness (happy)
Max Happiness (max_happy)
Traits: [hard worker, nimble fingers, keen eyes, sharp mind, pretty face, organized multitasker, big heart]

BUGLIST AND SECURITY CONCERNS:
By editing the URL, people will be able to send Proposals across worlds. Additionally, need to enforce that offered and asked items are properly limited to items from their respective owners.
Everything right now is handled by get requests, we should probably switch post request to... post requests.
Errors in the world turning allow for free execution of queued actions for one player
